# LineageOS Recorder Installer

This module installs the LineageOS Recorder app into `/system/priv-app/` and the necessary XML files to allow screen recording into `/system/etc/permissions/`.

## Warning!

On my device installing Magisk modules that modify system apps sometimes randomly removes apps from my launcher. **You might want to back up your launcher data first!**
